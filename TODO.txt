TODO:
-ENC+SRV: add multiple points of authentication: e.g. hash the computer name, hdd size, hdd model, cpu then compare with what's in .cfg file
-ENC: generate config encryption key from hardware
-SRV: remove DATABASE ERROR OCCURRED... when response is a success and no custom msg is defined
-SRV: when TEAM or LINE is deleted, make sure the player does not get lost
-ENC+TAB+SRV: when the sync data is received and parsed, submit SYNC_SUCCESS to the server to mark the log as sync_tablet or sync_encoder
-ENC: install script (to download and install all paths, settings, configs, etc.)

TESTING:
-ENC+SRV:introduce 404 errors in the cloud, see the response on the local encoder
-ENC+SRV:submit an existing uniqueID during activation
-ENC+SRV:submit ID that has been deactivated on the server

-TAB+SRV:submit invalid ID or customer
-TAB+SRV:what happens if all tagnames were deleted

-SRV:test all scenarios on the cloud and verify logs (e.g. adding/modifying/deleting users, teams, leagues, etc.)
-SRV: delete user from MYSQL, then try to modify/delete/activate him
-SRV: add team/user/league/customer/event that were previously deleted
-SRV: delete a team, see what happens to its players
-SRV: create event by one customer, have one own team, another team from a diff. customer. then modify the event and see if it syncs on the 2nd customer's encoder/tablet
